# LuckOS
 Novixx's Custom Windows XP Build

# Is LuckOS legal?
 Probably not. I did not use the Windows XP Source code (because that **IS** illegal) but I do use some binaries.
 
 The build tools include: Resource Hacker, a CSharp project and some batch files
 
# Ok, But how do I build this?
 Easy, just copy the files in the repository to a drive (can be subst'd) with the drive letter M:
 
 Then, go to M:\NVXLKOS\DEVTOOL and run BUILDLUCKOS.BAT
 
 The ISO will be in M:\NVXLKOS\CDBOOT
