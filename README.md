# LuckOS
 Novixx's Custom Windows XP Build

# Is LuckOS legal?
 Probably not. I did not use the Windows XP Source code (because that **IS** illegal) but I do use some binaries.
 
 The build tools include: Resource Hacker, a CSharp project and some batch files
 
# Ok, But how do I build this?
 Easy, just copy the files in the repository to a drive (can be subst'd) with the drive letter M:
 
 Then, go to M:\NVXLKOS\DEVTOOL and run BUILDLUCKOS.BAT
 
 The ISO will be in M:\NVXLKOS\CDBOOT
 
# Increasing the Build Number in winver
 To update the build number, use the INCBUILDNUM tool located in M:\NVXLKOS\DEVTOOL
 
# Increasing the Major Version Number in winver
 To update the major version number, edit the file M:\NVXLKOS\DEVTOOL\STORAGE\VERSION.RC (change the text "Version 1.0" to match the new version)
 Then run INCBUILDNUM, and use the same build number (or increase it)
 
# History of LuckOS
 LuckOS started in 2018, it was a modified installation (NOT AN ISO) that I only had on ONE COMPUTER (aka just a modified windows harddisk)
 
 It only had changed images (not even changed resources, just bmp and png files).
 
 Then in 2021 that computer broke (the harddisk)
 
 Then on 8/31/2022 I started this
